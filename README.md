I'm @JackDinsmore, an undergraduate physics student at MIT. Most of my repository is physics research I have conducted while at MIT and elsewhere, in Machine Learning, observational astronomy, astrophysics and the search for dark matter, and classical gravity. Other repositories include personal projects in various programming languages.

I love learning new languages and trying new things. Recently I've been learning Rust, and I plan to try out the `amethyst` crate and make another game. (I have designed other games before in OpenGL). I also sometimes write functional code, to help me with tasks I need to get done. Vokdh (a word processor for a language I invented) and Poetron (a Discord bot) are examples.
